        <p className='about-detail'>
          I studied Mechanical Engineering at the University of Arizona. After graduation, I began my career at Boeing as a Functional Test Manufacturing Engineer for the 777X-8 program, a developmental airplane at the time. My manager was aware of my limited experience in Python and asked me to create a web app that would promote team visibility.  As I started working on the project assigned by my manager, I quickly realized that my true passion lies in software engineering. The process of coding, debugging, and creating software solutions was incredibly fulfilling and enjoyable for me. It ignited a sense of excitement and motivation that I hadn't felt before. I realized that software engineering is where I truly excel and where I want to focus my career moving forward. I'm grateful for the opportunity to work on the project and for my manager, as it helped me discover my true passion and direction in the field of technology.

          Cooking has evolved from a simple task to a form of artistic expression that is truly soothing for my soul. With each dish, I embark on a culinary journey, carefully selecting ingredients, experimenting with flavors and textures, and creating a symphony of colors and aromas. The kitchen has become my canvas, and cooking has become my art form. As I chop, sauté, and simmer, I am transported to a world of creativity and inspiration, where my imagination and senses come alive. The act of cooking has become a therapeutic ritual, allowing me to pour my heart and soul into each dish, and share my passion with others. From the precise plating to the first bite, the joy and satisfaction I derive from cooking is unparalleled, filling my heart with warmth and contentment. Cooking has truly become a masterpiece that brings me solace, nourishment, endless inspiration for my soul and a way to connect through traveling.
